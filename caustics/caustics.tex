\begin{abstract}
In this paper we introduce a natural method for producing both refraction and reflection caustics in backward path tracing (e.g. bouncing around an eye ray in the scene until a light is found).
These caustics do not rely on a light location, and as such, do not rely on bidirectional or forward path tracing.
As such, these caustics allow for as many light sources as one would care for; the shapes and positions of the lights are completely arbitrary (can be bunny shaped, etc).
We use the standard Cornell box for testing the backward path tracer.

\section{Rasterizer versus ray tracer versus backward path tracer}

The three main visualization algorithms in contemporary graphics programming are the rasterizer, ray tracing, and path tracing.

The rasterizer literally converts vector graphics (generally, triangles) into raster graphics (pixels).
Generally, a depth buffer is used to discern which triangles to draw, and which to discard, depending on distance to the eye.
This depth testing algorithm does the job, but it is just simply not as programmable as a ray tracer or path tracer.

The ray tracer does a similar job, insomuch that it converts triangles into pixels.
Rather than using a depth buffer though, one generally uses a bounding volume hierarchy to determine eye ray / triangle intersection.

The path tracer is identical to the ray tracer, except that it also takes global illumination into account.
The path tracer uses the exact same bounding volume hierarchy setup as the ray tracer.
As we will soon see, caustics occur naturally in the case of the backward path tracer in particular.

Here we rate the three main visualization algorithms.
We rate them in terms of what is relatively easy, or naturally occurring, in each of the visualization algorithms.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{| l | r | r | r | r |}
  \hline
 Algorithm &  Reflections & Shadows & Refraction caustics & Reflection caustics \\
\hline
\hline
Rasterizer & No & No & No &  No \\
Ray tracer & Yes & Sharp & No & No  \\
Backward path tracer & Yes & Sharp / soft & Yes & Yes \\
  \hline  
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Clearly, the most suitable visualization algorithm for now (and in the future) is the backward path tracer.
This not to say that, for instance in the case of the rasterizer, there is no such thing as shadows.
It's just that the implementation of shadows is a kludgy affair, or not naturally occurring.

Although caustics can be produced using bidirectional or forward path tracing, they suffer from convergence (or lack thereof) problems.
These issues do not plague the backward path tracer.





\section{Path tracer code}
A full Vulkan code exists \cite{halayka}, using a very simple (e.g. not physically accurate) light transport algorithm.
The results given here can only get better with the improvement of the light transport algorithm.
This code is based off of Sascha Willems' work \cite{willems1, willems2}.

The reflections are faked -- the camera is flipped upside down, and reflected things masked and drawn.
In other words, reflections and shadows are not naturally occurring.
Global illumination is not taken into account.

In essence, instead of always producing a pseudorandom cosine-weighted reflection vector, refraction occurs for transparent objects.
Note that reflection caustics are created by reflective surfaces.
In the case where the surface is both transparent and reflective, a pseudorandom number should be generated to see which path to take.
