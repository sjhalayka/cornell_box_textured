\begin{abstract}
In this paper we introduce a method for producting refraction and reflection caustics in forward path tracing.
These caustics do not rely on a light location, and as such, do not rely on bidirectional or backward path tracing.
Thus, these caustics allow for as many light sources as one would care for; the shapes and positions of the lights are completely arbitrary (can be bunny shaped, etc).
We use the standard Cornell box for testing the path tracer.
\end{abstract}

\section{Rasterizer versus ray tracing versus path tracing}

Here we rate the three main visualization algorithms.
We rate them in terms of what is relatively easy, or naturally occurring, in each of the visualization algorithm.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{| l | r | r | r | r |}
  \hline
 Algorithm &  Reflections & Shadows & Refraction caustics & Reflection caustics \\
\hline
\hline
Rasterizer & No & No & No &  No \\
Ray tracer & Yes & Hard & No & No  \\
Forward path tracer & Yes & Hard / soft & Yes & Yes \\
  \hline  
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Clearly, the most suitable visualization algorithm for now (and in the future) is the forward path tracer.
This not to say that, for instance in the case of the rasterizer, there is no such thing as shadows.
It's just that the implementation of shadows is a kludge, or not naturally occurring.



\section{Path tracer code}
A full Vulkan code exists \cite{halayka}, using a very simple (e.g. not physically accurate) light transport algorithm.
The results given here can only get better with the improvement of the light transport algorithm.
This code is based off of Sascha Willems' work \cite{willems1, willems2}.

  \caption{ Standard rasterizer.
The surface is lit using Phong shading and omnidirectional shadow maps.
The reflections are faked -- the camera is flipped upside down, and reflected things masked and drawn.
In other words, reflections and shadows are not naturally occurring.
Global illumination is not taken into account.
This knight model, as well as MagicaVoxel, were made by the Twitter user @ephtracy.

In essence, instead of always producing a pseudorandom cosine-weighted reflection vector, refraction occurs for transparent objects.
